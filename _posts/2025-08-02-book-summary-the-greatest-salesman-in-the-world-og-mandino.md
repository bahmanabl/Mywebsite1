I recently read the book "The Greatest Salesman in the World" by Og Mandino. What's cool about it is that it's not your usual sales manual. It's more like a guide to life success. Instead of just focusing on selling stuff, the book dives into some deep thoughts and habits that can make you successful in all parts of your life. It's like a mentor giving you some great life advice. This book can seriously help you turn your life around with its wisdom and positive habits. So, it's not just about being a great salesperson; it's about being a better person overall and excelling at whatever you do. Plus, it's a short and captivating read. Once you start, you won't want to put it down until you've finished it. It's got a touching story that I absolutely loved! And guess what? It's sold over 50 million copies, which says a lot about how good it is.


The story in the book is about a young guy named Hafid living in ancient Jerusalem. He meets a wealthy trader who's on his deathbed and wants to share his success secret before he dies. Turns out, when he was young, he met a person who gave him 10 scrolls and asked him to promise that he would protect them for life until he saw a person who was hungry for that wisdom. And Hafid is the person who gets the 10 scrolls. Each scroll is a lesson itself and these lessons aren't old and outdated—they still totally apply to our world today. 


Scroll 1 – Today I begin a new life.

Scroll 2 – I will greet this day with love in my heart.

Scroll 3 – I will persist until I succeed.

Scroll 4 – I am nature’s greatest miracle.

Scroll 5 – I will live this day as if it is my last.

Scroll 6 – Today I will be master of my emotions.

Scroll 7 – I will laugh at the world. (Keep perspective)

Scroll 8 – Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold.

Scroll 9 – I will act now, I will act now, I will act now.

Scroll 10 – I will pray for guidance.


Here I will only talk about three scrolls that I think are more useful in life. 


<br>
## The first scroll says, “Today I begin a new life.”


This is like Hafid's wake-up call. It's about breaking free from those old habits that are holding you back. It's saying, "I'm not going to settle for mediocrity anymore." Hafid learns that to succeed, he needs to let go of bad habits and embrace good ones. It's a bit like getting rid of all the junk food and replacing it with healthy stuff. The lesson here is that no matter where you are in life, you can always start fresh. It's like hitting the reset button. Just like Hafid, you have the power to change your habits, your attitude, and your path.



<br>
## Scroll #6 says “Today, I will be master of my emotions.”

Hafid learns that mastering his emotions is like a superpower that helps him stay calm and composed, no matter what challenges come his way. Imagine you're in a high-pressure sales situation, and instead of getting nervous or anxious, you remain cool and confident. That's the kind of control over emotions this scroll is talking about. The lesson here is that emotions are like wild horses, and you're the cowboy trying to tame them. When you master your emotions, you become a more effective and persuasive person, whether you're in sales or just navigating everyday life. It's about staying cool under pressure and making wise decisions even when things get tough.



<br>
## The seventh scroll says, "I will laugh at the world."


Hafid learns that laughter is a powerful force. It's like a shield that protects you from the negativity and stress that the world can throw at you. why laugh at the world? Because it helps you stay in a cheerful spirit and reminds you that failures and setbacks are not permanent. Think of it like watching a good comedy movie when you're feeling down; it lifts your mood and makes you forget your worries for a while. The lesson here is that life is full of ups and downs, but laughter helps you keep your chin up. It's about facing difficulties with a smile, knowing that even the toughest situations will pass. 


<br>
 
So, this book is more than just a sales manual; it's a roadmap to achieving success in life. The lessons in these scrolls will help you excel at sales and reach new heights by becoming a better person on the whole. Whether you're looking to improve your sales skills, find personal growth, or simply enjoy a good read, this book is a must-read that can inspire and transform your life in remarkable ways.
