I recently read this book, The Magic of Believing by Claude Bristol. It is a wonderful book and if you are interested in discovering how to use your thoughts to create a happy and successful life, then you must read this book. The main message of the book is that if you ever hope to achieve successful results in any endeavor, you need to first believe that you can do it. I have learned much more than I thought from the book, and here I would like to share the main lessons with you.


<br>
## Key lesson #1: Thought is a Powerful Force


Claude Bristol believes thought is a powerful force because everything around us was once thought. The chairs, cars, and all material things around us were made after someone thought about them. He says, your life is a product of your thoughts, and if you want a good life, you must practice entertaining positive thoughts. Everything that has ever been created began as a thought. Many years ago, Buddha said, “All that we are is a result of all that we have thought.” Thought is the original source of all health, wealth, and prosperity. The famous saying goes, “We become what we think about.” Most of us are victims of mass thinking and we let other people’s opinions control our thinking. You have the power to choose any thought you want. Know yourself. Know your power.

## Key lesson #2: Subconscious mind is your key to success


The subconscious is the part of the mind that works while you sleep, relax, or are engaged in an unrelated task. The subconscious mind is the source of power. It is rooted in instinct. It embodies the feeling and wisdom of the ages. In order to use the resources of the subconscious, you must ask for something that is rightfully yours and within your capabilities. If you can understand the relationship between the conscious and the subconscious minds, Bristol says, you will get to the core of belief power. The subconscious constantly works to express our deepest beliefs and desires. It is a faithful servant, but to get the most from it requires greater respect for and faith in what it can do. Because the subconscious operates in terms of imagery, it is vital that we feed it mental pictures of what we desire. It can then go to work in 'living up to' the image placed before it, by giving us intuitions about what to do, where to go, who to meet. Somehow, the subconscious is connected to all other minds, and through the law of vibration and attraction, it can attract events and people to you that will assist in making your dreams a reality. However, it will only find ways to make the image real if that image is clear and convincing. So have a clear mental picture of what success looks like for you.

## Key lesson #3: Belief Makes Things Happen


Just believe. Believing will give you the power to succeed in everything you undertake. Back your belief with a strong will and you will succeed. The act of believing is the starting point to generating the power to succeed. There will never be any failures if people believe that their own fearful thoughts create hard times. As individuals think and believe, so they are. How many times have you heard it said, ‘Just believe you can do it and you can?’ Whatever the task, if begun with the belief that you can do it, it will be done perfectly. The force of belief cannot really work in our favor until the belief becomes literally part of us, settled in the subconscious mind as a fact. Strange as it may sound, we usually get what we believe we’ll get.


<br>
 
With the constant amount of bad news that surrounds us on any given day, I’m a true believer that we must carefully monitor what we watch and consume in our mental diets, but more importantly, make it a daily habit to study success and personal development.
