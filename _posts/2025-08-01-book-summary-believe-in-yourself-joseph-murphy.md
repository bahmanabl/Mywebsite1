Have you ever had a day when you wanted to do something, but then suddenly negative thoughts crept in and you started doubting yourself. You know, you are not alone. When it comes to negative self-talk, I think I could’ve easily win a Nobel Prize on that. Gosh, I used to be a miserable person. I remember sometimes these negative thoughts were so strong that I gave up even before starting. I got to a point and I said to myself, enough is enough. And since then, I've been doing all I can to change that negative self-talk. And one of the books I found super helpful is this one, Believe in Yourself by Joseph Morphy. His other book, The Power of Subconscious Mind, absolutely changed the way I look at my subconscious mind. And this book is also filled with great insights. 


You might ask, how should I believe in myself? Very good question. To answer that, first we have to know who is me. Here it's you. You have the conscious mind, subconscious mind, and then you have the body. Now the conscious mind has the ability to choose thoughts. Those thoughts turn into pictures and we turn those pictures into subconscious mind. And the subconscious mind has no ability to reject any thoughts. So it accepts them without any question and then it expresses the action through the body. Now, what is the problem? We have to go back to our childhood. When we were a child, the conscious mind wasn’t developed, and this is how we arrive at this world. This is the baby. No conscious mind. There is only the subconscious mind and it is wide open. You can put anything in it. Why do you think you speak the language you speak, you speak that language because you were surrounded by people that speak that language and the language just went into the subconscious mind. Why do you think you like the foods you like? It's programming. That's right. Now, let's stop and think about the environment we were raised in. Here is the baby. The ideas and thoughts and concepts that are going on around that baby are going right into that baby's subconscious mind. Now through repetition over and over and over again, and remember, the baby is getting it all day, every day, and this goes on for four or five years. And the baby reaches the age of four or five where they can start to think. That baby is programmed to think like the people he was surrounded by. If the people that were surrounding that baby, always lived in hard times, never believed in themselves, always doubted themselves, that's probably how that baby is going to grow up. Now, this is bizarre, but this is how it happens. It's how it happened to me. I was raised in a small village in an undeveloped country. We never believed in ourselves. There was always talk about how others can do it, but we can't. That you should be satisfied with what you've got.


Here we've got the baby with the subconscious programming and the conscious mind has developed. They have the ability to think, what are they going to think? They are going to think thoughts that are in harmony with programming of the subconscious mind. Now, this programming is literally controlling the behavior. Consciously, you can think of one thing, but subconsciously the other idea will be controlling you. We can sit down and read these self-help books and we say, yeah, I can do that. That makes sense. It's logical, but then we can't do it. Why? Because the subconscious programming is literally controlling your life. Now, let's think about of how this programming was formed. It was formed through repetition, the ideas being planted in your subconscious mind. Now you know why you are getting the results you're getting. It has nothing to do with your intellect, your intellect. You can figure out how to do things, but that doesn't mean you are going to do them. You hear people say, I believe that, but their behavior indicate they've never heard of it. Why? We believe something in the conscious level. On the subconscious level, the programming believes something else. We've got to take the beliefs that we have consciously determined by thinking and plant them in the place of the old belief. See, I used to believe that I couldn't do anything better than I was doing. The idea of doing something worthwhile with my life was farthest from my mind. You know something, as I am changing this programming, my whole world is changing. That's what it's all about. That's how we believe in ourselves. You've got to change your subconscious programming if you want to change your life. It's a beautiful concept to understand. It's terrible if you don't understand because it literally controls your life. Why do you think most people go right through their lives and keep getting the same results year after year after year? Well, it's just the way it is and they don't know. How the subconscious programming was formed? Through the repetition of information. How is this programming change? Repetition of information. You replace the negative and self-doubt thoughts with positive ones and you've got to repeat it maybe a thousand times a day. As I started reading more books from successful people and listening to their talks, I slowly changed my subconscious programming and I'm still doing that. That's how you start to believe in yourself. I want to thank you for watching this, but I'm going to ask you to share it with one of your friends. Say, come and read this. This is a great information to understand.
