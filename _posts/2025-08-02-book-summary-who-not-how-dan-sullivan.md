Have you ever found yourself stuck trying to solve a problem? Whether it's a personal or professional issue, we often get bogged down in the details, trying to figure out "how" to solve the problem. But what if I told you that there was a better way to approach problem-solving? That's the central idea behind the book "Who Not How" by Dan Sullivan and Dr. Benjamin Hardy. In "Who Not How," the authors suggest that instead of asking "how" to solve a problem, we should be asking "who" can help us solve the problem. This means that we should focus on leveraging the skills and strengths of others to achieve our goals. This shift in mindset can be transformative and can help us to achieve more in less time.


<br>
## Key Lesson #1: Focus on your unique abilities


One of the core ideas of "Who Not How" is that everyone has unique abilities that they can leverage to achieve success. For example, if you're a great writer but struggle with social media marketing, it makes sense to delegate marketing to someone who is skilled in that area. Then you will have more time to focus on writing and achieve better outcomes in less time. They tell the story of a small business owner who was struggling to grow his business. He was spending countless hours trying to do everything himself, from accounting to marketing. One day, he realized that he was spending more time on tasks that fall outside his skillset than the tasks that he was truly skilled at. He decided to hire an accountant and a marketing specialist to handle those tasks, and he was able to focus on growing the business. As a result, his business began to thrive, and he was able to achieve his goals. So, you need to be aware of your strengths and weaknesses and be willing to let go of tasks that are not in your wheelhouse.

## Key Lesson #2: Build a strong team


To shift from a "How" mindset to a "Who" mindset, you need to surround yourself with a strong team of people who have complementary skills and strengths. This means that we should be willing to invest time and resources into building relationships with the right people. The book tells a story about a woman who was struggling to build her business. She had a lot of great ideas, but she was finding it difficult to execute them on her own. She realized that she needed to build a team of people who shared her vision and could help her achieve her goals. She reached out to other entrepreneurs in her industry and began to build relationships with them. As a result, she was able to tap into their expertise and knowledge, and her business began to grow. So, focus on building a team of people who share your vision and are committed to helping you achieve your goals.

## Key Lesson #3: Embrace collaboration


The authors suggest that collaboration is key to achieving success in today's world. By working with others, you can achieve better outcomes than you could on your own. This means that you need to be willing to share your ideas and work with others to achieve your goals. This requires a shift in mindset from competition to collaboration. The book tells a story about a group of entrepreneurs who decided to collaborate on a project. They all had different areas of expertise, but they shared a common goal. By working together, they were able to achieve more than they ever could have on their own. They were able to share ideas, leverage each other's strengths, and ultimately create something that none of them could have created on their own.


<br>
So, in summary, "Who Not How" is a powerful book that provides a new approach to problem-solving and achieving success. By shifting from a "How" mindset to a "Who" mindset, we can tap into the expertise and knowledge of others to achieve better outcomes in less time. By focusing on your unique abilities, building a strong team, and embracing collaboration, you can achieve greater success and fulfillment in your life.
