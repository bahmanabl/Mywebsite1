Today, I've got a new book from Jim Rohn, my very own mentor. He was such a great thinker and my life transformed completely from the moment I started putting his wisdom into practice. Jim Rohn used to tell me, you can have more than you've got because you can become more than you are. He told me your life is not gonna change until you change and if you change everything in your life will change. If there is just one thing you must learn from this video, let it be this: "to have more, we must first become more." In his book, Five Major Pieces to the Life Puzzle, Jim Rohn talks about why some people succeed and others don't. He covers the five key components of success. These five pieces are: 


Philosophy: It's what we know 

Attitude: It's what we feel 

Activity: It's what we do 

Results: It's what we achieve. 

Lifestyle: It's how we live our life 


By learning about these pieces, you can completely change your life. You will stop blaming others and you will become much more proactive in designing your future. Now, let's dig more deeply into these five major pieces to success.


## Philosophy 
Our philosophy, which is our mindset, is the way we think. This is the cornerstone of success. There is only a small difference between people who succeed and others who don't. And that's the way they think. But this makes a huge difference and it's a major determinant of who succeeds and who doesn't. Jim, Ron says your philosophy is like the set of the sale. You need to make sure that you are set to sail in a given direction and that you won't let a little wind blow you off course. So if you want to change your life, you should start by changing the way you think.



## Attitude
This is the emotional side. It's how we feel about what we know. Jim Rohn says having the right attitude is a prerequisite for success and happiness. It's been said over and over again that attitude is everything. It determines how intensely we take action and therefore predicts the quality of the results we achieve. So to achieve success, you not only need to improve your intellect, but you also need to constantly improve your attitude. 



## Activity
This is simple. You will not achieve anything if you don't take action. If you have the right philosophy and a great attitude, without action, you will have nothing. To take control of your activity and move toward your goals, you need to have discipline and any discipline, even the smallest ones, if practiced every day, can put you on the path to success. And it starts an incredible process that can change your life forever. 



## Results
Results are the harvest of our past efforts. And it's only always in direct proportion to our efforts. It's been said that "as you sow, so shall you reap." Look very carefully at what you've got if you don't like the results you're getting, examine what you are sowing. If you don't change what you are sowing, you will reap the same results. It's madness to do things the way you've always done and expect different results. So unless you change who you are right now, your life will remain almost the same. Results is the name of the game, what other game is there, and if you don’t have the results you want, you have no one to blame but yourself. Remember what Jesus said about the results:  “Ye shall know them by their fruits.”



## Lifestyle 
This is the way we live our lives. Jim Rohn talks about how many people say, I will have a bitter attitude when I'm wealthy or I will be happy when I achieve this or that. He instead suggests designing the lifestyle you want and then start living it, as they say. Many have learned how to earn well, but they haven't learned how to live well. So if you wish to be wealthy, study the wealth and if you wish to be happy, study happiness. Everything starts with education, and this will pave your way toward a happy, healthy, and prosperous life. Remember, learn to be happy with what you have while striving for what you want. 



Jim Rohn says if we could have a mental picture in our minds of how the future will be, given our current direction, perhaps we would become more serious about our lives.
