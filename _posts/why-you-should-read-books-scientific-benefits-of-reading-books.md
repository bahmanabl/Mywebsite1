I think we all know that reading is somehow good for us. Well, at least that's what our parents and teachers have taught us. In recent years, there has been so much scientific research that shows reading is not only a fun activity, but it also has many benefits for both mental and physical health. In this video, we look at some of these benefits that are backed by science.

Did you know in one study, they actually found that 88% of all the millionaires they interviewed said they read 30 minutes or more each day on self-improvement stuff? That's crazy! The study indeed concluded that reading was a key factor in their success.


A lot of studies indicate that reading improves your brainpower and literally changes your mind. To stay fit and have a healthy body, you have to work out, right? Exercise keeps us healthy by making our muscles stronger. Reading is a workout for our brains like going to the gym is a workout for our bodies. When you read, you're improving the function of your brain, or rather, you're improving the brain's connectivity. A study conducted in 2013 found that reading a novel for only nine days improved brain connectivity, and that effect persisted for several days after.


Do you feel stressed at work? Then maybe you should start reading more often because reading reduces stress significantly. Well, at least according to a study conducted in 2009 at the University of Sussex. The researchers were looking into how different activities were lowering stress by measuring heart rate and muscle tension. According to a study published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research, reading was the best way to relax. That study shows that reading for only six minutes is enough to reduce stress by 68%. This was a better way to relax than going for a walk, which reduced stress by 42% or listening to music, which reduced stress by 61%. Who would’ve thought that reading is more effective at reducing stress than going for a walk or listening to music? I hope the researchers didn’t make that up.


Reading can also improve sleep quality if done before bed. According to a study published in the Journal of Sleep Medicine, reading for just six minutes before bed can reduce stress levels by up to 68% and improve sleep quality by up to 43%. This is because reading is a relaxing activity that can help people unwind and de-stress after a long day. Plus, it can help you establish a bedtime routine, which can regulate your sleep patterns and improve overall sleep quality.


Reading keeps the brain active and engaged in comprehending different words, characters, and certain scenes in a book. According to a study published in the Journal of Neurology, brain-stimulating activities like reading books and writing will preserve and improve your memory. The study discovered that people with good reading habits experienced much slower memory loss than those who didn't read. This is because reading stimulates the brain and keeps it active, it’s like a workout for the brain, and if done regularly, will help to maintain brain function and prevent deterioration. It means better brain health for you during old age.


Reading has been shown to increase empathy and social skills. In a study published in the journal Science, researchers found that people who read literary fiction were better at recognizing emotions in others than those who read non-fiction. This is because reading fiction allows people to explore the perspectives and experiences of others, which helps them develop a deeper understanding of human emotions and behavior. In addition, reading also improves communication skills and vocabulary, which are important for social interaction.


So, there you have it! These are just a few of the scientific benefits of reading books. Whether you're into fiction or non-fiction, reading can help you escape from the stresses of daily life and immerse yourself in a different world. Plus, Scientific research has provided much evidence to support the benefits of reading, and it is an activity that people of all ages can benefit from. So, why not pick up a book and start reading today?
