Recently I heard that bob proctor just passed away. So I picked up one of his classic books to read in his memory. He was a legendary teacher with his unique way of teaching and my life was completely transformed from the day I started listening to him. In fact, I loved bob proctor so much that I decided to go to one of his seminars. It was just right before all the lockdowns started and I remember I was a little bit late and when I entered the big room, the seminar was already started. So I decided to wait beside the door and look for an empty seat. Then they suddenly introduced bob proctor to the stage and Bob just entered the room from the door I was standing by. I was so excited to see him that close that I couldn’t control myself and I just ran toward him and said hi and shake his hand. He smiled and said welcome. I was thrilled and loved the positive energy that was emanating from him. That was my only encounter with bob and that’s how I will remember him for the rest of my life.


When I first heard bob speaking, I was literally in one of the darkest times of my life. I’ve set a lot of goals and was taking a lot of actions but nothing seemed to work quite well for me. In fact, I was failing miserably. Then I heard bob talking about the mind. Our minds. He said the secret to a better and richer life lies in understanding how our mind works. But the problem is that we don’t have a picture of our minds. Then he put on this picture and said, this is you and this is me. You have a body and a mind. Part of the mind is conscious and the other is subconscious. Now there is a power that flows to and through us. As this power flows into us, we can make out of it anything we choose by our conscious mind. And build a picture of what we want. Now when you take that idea and turn it to the subconscious mind, it will change the vibration of the body and that will change the results you’re getting. And that is the name of the game, it is the results. A great teacher a long time ago said, “ye shall know them by their fruits”. The ancient Greeks referred to the subconscious mind as the heart and they said, “as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.” If you choose an idea and you place it in here, instantly and automatically you move this thing called a body which is nothing but a mass of energy into a new vibration. That causes them to act differently. You see the action is caused by the vibration. And the only way to change the vibration is to put a new idea into the subconscious mind. And since the subconscious mind is the emotional mind, this only happens when you get emotionally involved with the idea. Let’s consciously build a positive idea, get emotionally involved with that idea, and simultaneously we move into a positive vibration. Everything changes. That takes some mental strength. How do you develop that mental strength? I’ll tell you how, by repetition. The ideas that you impress to your subconscious mind, over and over and over again, ultimately become fixed in there. Every time you think about that idea, you give that picture more strength. Dr maxwells Maltz in his book Psycho-Cybernetics pointed out in approximately 21 days of doing this with the idea, that idea will become fixed in your subconscious mind.  This is referred to as a habit. A habit is an idea that’s fixed in our subconscious mind, requires absolutely no conscious thought any longer, and causes us to act on it. Do you know you drive your car through the ideas that are fixed in your mind? When you first started to drive, you were all hands and legs. Every bit of conscious attention was on what you were doing. Many of the things we do are done by habit.  Think about your days. You probably do a lot of things during the day that you really don’t want to do. And if someone asked you, why are you doing that, you may say I don’t know. Every one of us knows how to do things better than we’re doing, our problem is we don’t know why we are not doing it. Why we are not doing the things we already know how to do. You know that when you check social media right after you wake up, you feel bad. We know but sometimes we still do it. You know if that’s the only thing you changed, the quality of your life will improve.

You have all it takes to have a rich and fulfilling life. You have the mental faculties and the power flows to you. It’s just a matter of learning how to direct it. Just build in your mind, a picture of exactly how you want to live, what kind of person you want to be, how much money you want to have. Do this over and over again and get emotionally involved with that picture. And you’ll see the results will come to you. That’s exactly the way it works, abundance is our birthright. There isn’t anyone better than you, we’re all the same. The difference is in our results. Change your results by changing your mind. So basic, so simple. Now if you’re gonna change, you know there is only one time to do it, right now, right now.
