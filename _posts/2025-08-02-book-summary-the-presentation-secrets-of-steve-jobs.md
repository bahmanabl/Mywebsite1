What makes a great presentation? Have you ever wondered how to leave a lasting impression with your presentation? To find the answer to this question, you don’t need to look further than “The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs.”  Steve Jobs was one of the most innovative and influential presenters of our time, he had a unique ability to connect with the audience and get his message across. But what made his presentations so successful and how we can do the same? In this summary, I’ll share with you three key lessons that I learned from the book that can help us to take our presentation skills to the next level and present like Steve Jobs. 


<br>
## Key Lesson #1: To get people’s attention, tell them how you will solve their problems


When giving a presentation, it's important to answer the question that's on everyone's mind: "Why should I care about this?" The answer is simple - you're giving them a solution to their problems. But first, you need to introduce the problem - the villain in your story. Paint a picture of a situation where people are frustrated with the lack of a solution, using tangible details to really drive the pain home. Now it's time for your product, the hero, to come to the rescue. Explain in simple terms, without jargon, how your product solves the audience's problem. For example, when Steve Jobs introduced the iPod, he first described the frustration people had with the bulky and expensive portable CD players. Then he revealed the hero, the iPod, which allowed people to carry their entire music library in their pockets for the first time. Remember, what you're really selling is the promise of a better life, free from the problems you've just described. This is where passion comes in - Steve Jobs was passionate about the problems his products could solve and that's what made him an inspiring communicator.



<br>
## Key Lesson #2: Use the rule of three


The "Rule of Three" is a powerful concept in communications. It says that lists of three are more effective because they feel more natural than lists of other lengths. Steve Jobs was a master of using the "Rule of Three" to captivate his audience and drive home his message. He understood that people can only recall three important points from any presentation, so he always made sure to boil down the key features of his products into three key points that his audience could easily remember. For example, when introducing the first iPhone, Steve Jobs said the iPhone combined three devices: a touch screen iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator. When introducing a new product, Jobs would always focus on three key features: design, performance, and affordability. Jobs' ability to use the "Rule of Three" in his presentations was just one of the many elements that made him such a successful communicator. By following his example and using the "Rule of Three" in your own presentations, you can make sure that your audience takes away the most important information and remembers it long after your presentation is over.

## Key Lesson #3: Make your presentation stick by adding an emotional touch


To make your presentation really stand out, you need to add an emotional touch. The key is to have a "Wow" moment that will get your audience's attention and leave a lasting impression. People may forget the details of your presentation, but they'll never forget the way it made them feel. To create this “Holy Shit” moment, think about something exciting that you can include in your presentation. For example, when introducing the first MacBook air, Steve Jobs brought a manila envelope to the stage and pulled out the MacBook from inside it to show how thin the new MacBook was. This act created a "Wow" moment that left a lasting impression on the audience. By revealing the product in this way, Jobs was able to make a statement about its design and demonstrate how the product was unlike anything they had seen before. This moment not only showed the audience the physical attributes of the product but also created an emotional connection with the audience by showcasing its uniqueness and sleek design. The "Wow" moment created by Jobs was a crucial element in his presentations as it made his message more memorable and added an emotional touch to the presentation.

So, in summary, To present as impressively as Steve Jobs, make your presentation as easy as possible for the audience to understand and remember. Start by showing people how you can solve their problems. Use the rule of three and add an emotional touch to make your presentation stand out.
